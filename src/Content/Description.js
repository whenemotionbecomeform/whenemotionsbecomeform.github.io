      "When Emotions Become Form" is an hommage to Harald Szeemann's exhibition
      "When Attitudes Become Form" whose message signifies not only in its year
      1969 but until today. In the exhibition, Szeemann highlighted the
      importance of the process of conceptualizing the theory more than creating
      the artwork itself, which accentuated the role of curators as much of that
      of the artist in the realm of modern art. We also share the same notion by
      expanding such role to machines, proving that “(human) emotions” can be
      expressed in “AI-form”. Our artwork presupposes color and plane geometry
      as fundamental elements of visual arts. By training via GANs (Generative
      Adversarial Networks), the AI analyses various images labeled with human
      emotions and generates obscure shapes and colors in layers through
      installation to present the ability of machine learning in interpreting
      abstract images such like such as the Korean abstract painting Dansaekhwa:
      We first consider the norms for positive and negative emotion-laden words
      and their color associations. And we used lines or circles on a virtual
      canvas and achieved different results for marks on a page under various
      conditions of emotions. Particularly, “Amusement" was found to be the most
      consistent with “Dialog” by Lee Ufan in 2011.
